# Quantified Self Austin #06 - Skyler's Links  

This is a list of links to devices I brought or discussed during our meeting. I hope they are helpful. I know this is really long but let me know if I missed something we discussed.

QS Trackers I have used and liked  
----------------------------------------------
* Withings  - [Link](http://www.withings.com) -  *I use old scale and cuff. Wi-Fi is automatic on scale. Can import Withing's data almost anywhere*  
 
* FitBit - [Link](http://www.fitbit.com) - *Love the ubiquity of Fitbit data. It integrates with everything. This device started my QS addiction. Only downside was losing the thing or forgetting to put in my pocket. The new band would stop this*  
 
* Basis Band - [Link](http://www.mybasis.com) - *Tracks Heartrate, Temp, Steps, etc. Now testing. Don't like lack of API but product good so far*  
 
* UT FIT Program - [Link](http://www.edb.utexas.edu/fit/bodycompfit.php) - *DEXA Scans, VO2MAx, etc. Link is DEXA offering. Click around for VO2Max and other services. I was very impressed by them and thought the prices were very reasonable. This program is used for training their sports physiology students. Amazing battery of tests that they run you through. Feels like you are invited to the NFL combine. Open to the public but they offer discounts to Longhorns*  
 
* 23andMe - [Link](https://www.23andme.com) - *SNP Genomics testing. Now costs $99. Whole genomes are now going for 5k. This was good to tide me over till Whole Genome Sequencing  < 1000 in a year or so.*  
 
* HeartMath EmWave2  - [Link](http://www.heartmathstore.com/item/6310/emwave2) - *HRV Device for Coherence*  
 
* IBGStar - [Link](http://www.ibgstar.us) - *Blood Glucose meter for iPhone*  
 
* Glooko - [Link](https://www.glooko.com) - *Glucose Meter Adapter. Alternative to IBGStar. It is iPhone Connector for popular existing meters*  
 
* Zeo - [Link](http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/)  *Great device. Only popular QS sleep tracker that actually gives real deep sleep numbers. Unfortunately they are now in Chapter 7. :-(*  
 
* MyndPlay  - [Link](http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-mobile) *EEG Biofeedback for iOS. NOTE: Excited about some new EEG projects that should release by end of year. I got to see a prototype of the Muse from Interaxon [Link](http://interaxon.ca/muse/) at QS2012 at Stanford. The developers were great and the device rocked.*   
 
* Lamond Fitness Bike  - [Link](http://www.lemondfitness.com/product_detail/116/g-force-rt) - *I use this as a desk with a computer tray table.*  
  
* DirectLabs - [Link](https://www.directlabs.com) - *Order any lab test you want for tracking without a doctor. They have good monthly specials. There are now some lower price alternatives if you google. AnyLabTestNow has walk in appointments at their own locations in Austin.*
 

QS API's Mentioned  
---------------------------
*For programmers only.. Use an iOS or other integrator app, or do spreadsheets if non-techie*


### Fitness:  
* Locker Project - [Link](http://lockerproject.org) - *Originally built by Singly. Great data integration API code. Check out some of Singly's other Github projects like Hallway for social and other integration API's especially if you are building for iOS or Android. You may want to consider other integration API's like Brett Terpstra's Slogger for DayOne or IFTTT for rule based integration.*

* Locker Project Github - [Link](https://github.com/LockerProject)

* Beau Gunderson Video - [Link](http://quantifiedself.com/2012/04/beau-gunderson-on-online-activity-aggregation/)  - *Fitness API integration via Locker Project*
  	
### Healthcare:  
* Direct Project - [Link](http://wiki.directproject.org) - *Oreilly Sponsored Standards for interchange Focused on healthcare*
  
* DocGraph Project - [Link](http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/11/docgraph-open-social-doctor-data.html)  *Fred Trotter's finished Kickstarter project (produced a dataset via Medicare FOIA Requests on which doctors referred patients to which doctors. An attempt to judge physician quality via doctors referrals)* 


Recommended iOS Apps I mentioned  
---------------------------------------------------
* MyFitnessPal - [Link](http://www.myfitnesspal.com) - *Calorie counter app w/ Barcode Scanner. I hate any QS tracking that requires me to do things manually. This may be and exception since it makes me mindful of what I am eating. I used LoseIt! in early-mid 2012 and switched. I don't know if LoseIt! caught up to MyFitnessPal in the interim. Both are very good at data sharing.*

* Digifit  - [Link](http://www.digifit.com/what-is-digifit/compatibility/) - *Great integrated iOS Fitness App. Grabs my data from many devices. Note: Runkeeper, MapMyFitness and others also have integration functionality. You may prefer them over Digifit for features or workout focus.*
  
* Tactio Health  - [Link](http://www.tactiosoft.com/en/products/tactiohealth)  - *Great integrated IOS Health Dashboard. Integrates with most of my devices.*
  
* SweetBeat - [Link](http://www.sweetwaterhrv.com/products.shtml)  - *iOS HRV App - Like HeartMath but not focused on coherence. Must make sure you have the right chest strap.*
  
* Don't have a favorite mood app. I tried 10-15 on both iOS and Web but never loved any enough to keep entering data.
  
* Good Habit  - [Link](http://goodtohear.co.uk) - *Habit forming and tracking app. Note: Lift, Habit List, and Due were all interesting. Liked the simplicity of Good Habit - (Habit Forming App). You may prefer more detail and social features of other apps.*
  
* 28 Spoons Later  - [Link](http://store.neurosky.com/products/28-spoons) - *Brainwave Game for iOS using MyndPlay EEG. My son love bending spoons with his mind b4 Zombies eat his brain*
  
* Zombies, Run! -  [Link](https://www.zombiesrungame.com) - *Motivational IOS App for Jogging*
